function d = strdist(r,b)

% Edits from Polityko's work: set krk always 0, cas always 1

%d=strdist(r,b,krk,cas) computes Levenshtein and editor distance 
%between strings r and b with use of Vagner-Fisher algorithm.
%   Levenshtein distance is the minimal quantity of character
%substitutions, deletions and insertions for transformation
%of string r into string b. An editor distance is computed as 
%Levenshtein distance with substitutions weight of 2.
%d=strdist(r) computes numel(r);
%d=strdist(r,b) computes Levenshtein distance between r and b.
%If b is empty string then d=numel(r);
%d=strdist(r,b,krk)computes both Levenshtein and an editor distance
%when krk=2. d=strdist(r,b,krk,cas) computes a distance accordingly 
%with krk and cas. If cas>0 then case is ignored.
%
%Example.
